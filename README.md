# CleanArchitecturePoc
This is a proof-of-concept MVC & Web Api app that implements certain concepts taught in the [Become a Full-stack .NET Developer - Architecture and Testing](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/full-stack-dot-net-developer-architecture-testing/transcript) course at Pluralsight.

The concepts I'm trying to implement in this POC are the following:
- Repository pattern (TODO)
- Unit of work pattern (TODO)
- Dependency inversion principle (TODO)
